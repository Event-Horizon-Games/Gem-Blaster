# Gem Blaster
Ton of credit to [this](https://learntodroid.com/how-to-make-a-simple-2d-android-game-with-unity/) guide. Basically just followed that and then adjusted to make my own

### Note
This is mainly just for research and display purposes. It is not good nor do I play on improving it in any way. I just did it and want to show it off.
